# Maze Generator and Solver

This project implements a maze generator and solver using different algorithms. The goal is to generate a random maze, solve it using various algorithms, and visualize the results.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Generate a maze using **Prim's Algorithm** or **Recursive Backtracking**.
- **Maze Solving**: Solve the generated maze using the following algorithms:
  - **A* Algorithm** (A Star)
  - **Right Hand Rule (RH)**
  - **Left Hand Rule (LH)**
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  
- **Maze Visualization**: Display the maze in a console-based graphical format, showing walls, paths, and visited cells.


## Search Algorithm Visualization

This section includes GIFs demonstrating how different search algorithms solve mazes with varying levels of complexity. The GIFs show the following algorithms in action:

The order of the algorithms in each GIF is as follows: On the first row, the algorithms are DFS, BFS, and A*; on the second row, the algorithms are RH and LH.

### 1. Single Path Maze
This GIF demonstrates the algorithm solving a maze with only one valid path. In this scenario, the algorithm should be able to find the only available solution. All five algorithms are visualized solving the same maze.

### 2. Medium Density Maze
This GIF shows the algorithm solving a maze with a medium density of walls. In this case, there are two or more possible paths or solutions. The algorithms need to choose between the available options. All five algorithms are visualized solving the same maze.

## Structure

### `Cell` Structure

Each cell in the maze is represented by the following attributes:

- **visited**: Marks if the cell has been visited.
- **row** and **col**: Coordinates of the cell in the maze.
- **northWall** and **eastWall**: Indicates whether the north and east walls of the cell are present (walls shared between adjacent cells).
- **path**: Marks if the cell is part of the solution path.
- **search**: Marks if the cell is currently being searched.
- **pathIndexes**: A vector storing path indexes used for solving.
- **open** and **closed**: Used in the A* algorithm to mark if the cell is open or closed.
- **hCost**: Heuristic cost for the A* algorithm (estimated cost from the current cell to the target).
- **gCost**: Actual cost from the start cell to the current cell.
- **fCost**: Total cost (gCost + hCost) used in A* algorithm.
- **parent**: Pointer to the parent cell, used in A* for path reconstruction.
